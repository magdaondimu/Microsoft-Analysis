# Microsoft New Movie Studio
Author: Magdalene Ondimu
# Overview
This project analyzes and recommends the genre of movies the new Microsoft studio will be showing, the market that it should focus more on, and the existing studios that they can partner/collaborate with to make it as they get into the movie industry.
# Business Problem
Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio and has no idea how to do it. I help them to know the kind of movies they should produce, their target market, and the studios they can work with.
# Data
Data was obtained from existing movie databases. That is Box Office MojoLinks to an external site. IMDBLinks to an external site. Rotten TomatoesLinks to an external site. TheMovieDBLinks to an external site. The NumbersLinks to an external site. The data file provides the movie title, the year produced, their grossings in both foreign and domestic markets, the type of movies produced, and the studios that produced them.
# Methods
The project uses descriptive analysis, which shows the trends of the movies watched, how much they grossed in both international and domestic markets, and the studios that produced these movies.
# Results
Most foreign markets receive box office movies better than the domestic markets.

The genre of the movies is important so that Microsoft can know which movies they can produce that appeal to the audience.

Studios always play an important role as they can have a choice of whom they partner with as this can help them reach a bigger audience.

# Conclusion
This analysis leads to a few recommendations as Microsoft embarks on this new venture they should:
. Produce movies that are preferred by their target audience as this will help them have a good return on their revenue.
. Movies produced should also target the foreign market because this is there is a good return on their revenue.
. Consider working with existing studios as this will help them reach a bigger audience.
